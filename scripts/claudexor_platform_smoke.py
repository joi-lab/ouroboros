"""One small delegated task through Claudexor, from inside Ouroboros, on one platform.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Stated first because a green check is read
by people who will not open this file (owner directive D20, and the question he
left open beside it as Q8):

  PROVES  — that on THIS operating system Ouroboros can discover the Claudexor
            daemon, negotiate the protocol, register a run root, start a MUTATING
            run pinned to the named harness, poll it to a terminal state, read its
            PRIMARY ARTIFACT to EOF, observe the child's edit on disk, and read
            back the applied-containment facts. For a managed runtime it also
            exercises the serving closure's identity-bound graceful stop, then
            ordinary CLI shutdown over an active fake run and legacy custody. That is
            the transport, lifecycle, platform paths and Ouroboros-to-Claudexor seam. The artifact read
            is a plain EOF read verified against the size the run itself reported
            — it is NOT the production custody acknowledgement, which never runs
            here.

  DOES NOT PROVE — that a SUBSCRIPTION harness works on this platform. No
            subscription can be authenticated in CI: the vendor logins are
            interactive and machine-bound, and putting a live OAuth token in a
            repository secret is not something this project does. The live lane
            therefore runs on explicit API keys: ``authPreference`` is ``api_key``
            where production sends ``subscription``. A subscription regression is
            caught by the operator's own local run before the PR, not here.

  ALSO DOES NOT PROVE (fixture lane only) — anything about what wraps a real child
            PROCESS. The ``fake-*`` harnesses are in-process generators; nothing is
            spawned. Only the live lane spawns. And the fixture request does NOT
            carry the ``execution.delegated`` marker: on a host with a kernel
            boundary the delegated mutating shape demands ``external_sandbox_full``,
            which no ``fake-*`` adapter maps, so the engine refuses the lane
            (verified against 3.3.7-rc.0). The delegated run shape itself is
            exercised only by the live lane.

WHY THE POOL IS PINNED. ``primaryHarness`` alone only prefers a lane WITHIN the
engine's pool, and the engine's AUTO-pool excludes ``fake-*`` routes by design
(``manifest.kind === "fake"`` is filtered before routing), so an unpinned fixture
request never starts the fake lane at all — it routes to whatever real harness the
doctor admits, or dies with ``no doctor-ok harness``. Both requests therefore pin
``harnesses: [<route>]`` next to ``primaryHarness``; an explicit pool also turns any
later ineligibility into a loud typed refusal instead of a silent substitution.

NO PLATFORM BRANCHES IN THE VERDICT. Whether a boundary exists is read out of what
the engine RECORDED for this attempt (``confinement_mechanism`` together with the
path it proved it denies), never from ``sys.platform`` — D21, and
``docs/DELEGATED_ADMISSION.md`` §8. Only macOS has a kernel mechanism and the owner
has ruled out kernel boundaries elsewhere, so off macOS a delegated run gets a scoped
HOME, records no mechanism, and completes normally with that absence disclosed. This
script therefore asserts NOTHING about containment: it reports whatever the attempt
recorded, so both outcomes are legible and neither is a refusal.

FAILS LOUDLY, NEVER SKIPS. Every refusal on the way — an absent seam, an engine
below the delegated-marker floor, an unreachable daemon, a run that never reaches a
terminal state, a child that produced no edit — exits non-zero with a named reason.
The live lane permits one second model attempt only when the first run succeeded,
its primary artifact was read to EOF, and the README stayed byte-identical; a second
no-edit result is still hard red. There is deliberately no "harness unavailable,
skipping" branch: the whole point of the gate is to notice when the delegated path
stops working on a platform.
